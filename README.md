# Hey!

This is my sites source code
It's pretty rough, I dont understand HTML enough to make it look how I want it to, but I tried and this is the result

[This tutorial by Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPJVi797Uy0) has helped me a ton so thank you <3

# What I used to create this website?
I used [Haikei](https://haikei.app/) to create the background to my site
I used [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) as the font
